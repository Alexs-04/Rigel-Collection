# Rigel Collection

The Rigel collection is a project that attempts to unify some past versions of a very simple management software; on my GitHub profile you can see these past versions that have been left unfinished and simply do not work.

## Will it work?
Well, the purpose of this project is to create different modules that communicate with each other. Rigel is the backend, built with Spring Boot; rigel_dream is the frontend for the web view, built with React; and finally, I plan to add one more module for the Android version, built with Jetpack Compose. It might include KMP, but I'm not sure.

## Technologies used
- Spring Boot
- React
- Jetpack Compose (planned)
- Kotlin Multiplatform (planned)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker(planned)
